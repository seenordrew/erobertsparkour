		<p>Since starting in 2006, Eric has trained with and learned from other practitioners in Ecuador, USA, France, Korea, Russia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and Hong Kong. This has allowed Eric to experience a wide range of styles and movement philosophies, which has in turn broadened his perception of movement as a whole.</p>

		<p><strong>Eric seeks to provide an accessible and inclusive environment for people to learn to overcome obstacles through exploration and discovery.</strong> This is done through task oriented learning, progressive skill training, and setting attainable challenges.</p>
		
		<p>As a coach, Eric has organized and taught independent workshops, founded the parkour club at Lewis &amp; Clark College, worked as an instructor at Revolution Parkour Beaverton and as head instructor at The Playground Gym in Portland, Oregon, USA. He currently coaches at SharedSpace in Hong Kong as well. This has allowed Eric to teach students of all ages and backgrounds, from 5 years old to 70 years old.</p>

		<h3>Why Parkour?</h3>

		<p><strong>All ages | All Abilities | All Over the Place!</strong></p>

		<p><em>Parkour builds physical, emotional, and mental strength, and teaches the practitioner the skills necessary to see any obstacle as an opportunity for growth. It encourages people to challenge themselves, in order to find their best self. Exciting and stylized videos online make parkour look daunting or even impossible. But parkour is about learning to overcome obstacles, it doesnâ€™t actually matter what the obstacle is or how big or small. While one practitioner might seek to jump and land on a thin metal rail at height, another might seek to jump over a waist-high wall with increasing fluidity and grace. Yet another practitioner might work to develop the ability to get over a waist-high wall, at all! Everyone has their own personal obstacles to overcome.</em></p>
